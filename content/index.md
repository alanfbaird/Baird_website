### About Me

I am a postdoctoral research associate working as part of the 
[geophysics group](http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/geophysics/index.htm) 
in the [School of Earth Sciences](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/earthsciences/) 
at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk). My research 
interests lie at the interface between stress, seismicity, and structures 
in geological settings of various scales. My current research focusses 
on the use of microseismicity and geomechanical models to characterise 
fractured petroleum reservoirs. I am also interested in crustal-scale 
seismicity, specifically in better understanding the causes and structural 
controls of earthquakes in the continental interiors.
